abstract: We consider two-stage hybrid protocols that combine quantum resources and classical resources to generate classical correlations shared by two separated players. Our motivation is twofold. First, in the near future, the scale of quantum information processing is quite limited, and when quantum resource available is not sufficient for certain tasks, a possible way to strengthen the capability of quantum schemes is introducing extra classical resources. We analyze the mathematical structures of these hybrid protocols, and characterize the relation between the amount of quantum resources and classical resources needed. Second, a fundamental open problem in communication complexity theory is to describe the advantage of sharing prior quantum entanglement over sharing prior randomness, which is still widely open. It turns out that our quantum and classical hybrid protocols provide new insight into this important problem.
