abstract: It has been known that all bipartite pure quantum states can be self-tested, i.e., any such state can be certified completely by initially measuring both subsystems of this state by proper local quantum measurements and subsequently verifying that the correlation between the measurement choices and the outcomes satisfies a specific condition. In such a protocol, a key feature is that the conclusion can still be reliable even if involved quantum measurements are untrusted, where quantum nonlocality is crucial and plays a central role, and this means that each party has to conduct at least two different quantum measurements to produce a desirable correlation. Here, we prove that when the underlying Hilbert space dimension is known beforehand, an arbitrary d√ód bipartite pure state can be certified completely (up to local unitary transformations) by a certain correlation generated by a single measurement setting on each party, where each measurement yields only 3d outcomes. Notably, our protocols do not involve any quantum nonlocality. We believe that our result may provide us a remarkable convenience when certifying bipartite pure quantum states in quantum labs.
